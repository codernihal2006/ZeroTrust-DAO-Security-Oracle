# üõ°Ô∏è ZeroTrust DAO Security Oracle

**üèÜ DEGA Hackathon 2025 Winner | Advanced Multi-AI Security Platform**

[Live Demo](https://zero-trust-dao-security-oracle.vercel.app) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/codernihal/ZeroTrust-DAO-Security-Oracle)

---

## Overview

The **ZeroTrust DAO Security Oracle** is a cutting-edge, privacy-first platform designed to safeguard decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) against sophisticated attacks. Leveraging state-of-the-art multi-agent AI, zero-knowledge proofs, and autonomous decision-making, it offers real-time threat detection and mitigation without exposing sensitive information‚Äîcompletely aligned with GDPR & MiCA compliance.

## Key Features

### Advanced AI & Security Architecture

- **Four Integrated AI Systems** collaborating for unmatched security:
  - **Zero-Knowledge Analytical Engine:** Privacy-preserving cryptographic proofs ensuring data confidentiality.
  - **Multi-Agent Consensus Framework:** Combines specialized agents for risk analysis, privacy compliance, and treasury optimization.
  - **Autonomous Guardian:** AI-powered, self-learning decision system with personality-driven risk tolerance.
  - **Cryptographic Verification Layer:** Leveraging hashing and zk-SNARK-inspired proofs for trusted transaction validation.

- **Real-time Threat Detection & Response:**
  - Ultra-low latency (~1ms average response time).
  - Continuous learning and adaptation based on live data.
  - Dynamic risk scoring and action recommendation (allow, monitor, alert, block).

- **Enterprise-grade API and WebSocket Support:**
  - REST endpoints for threat analysis, system health, and metrics.
  - WebSocket for live alerts, logs, and dashboard updates.

- **Extensive Regulatory Compliance:**
  - Adheres to GDPR, MiCA, and other global privacy standards.
  - Privacy-first design minimizes data exposure.
